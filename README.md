### App Walkthough GIF

`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walkthough `gif` in the image tag below, `YOUR_GIF_URL_HERE`. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (ðŸš« Remove this paragraph after after adding gif)

### Notes

The biggest challenge I faced doing this project is understanding how APIs work and how we can use and implement them into the app.

## Open-source libraries used
- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Android
